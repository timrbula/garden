title: Digital Garden
---

I've long been a follower of Maggie Appleton. I recall reading Digital Garden [blog post](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) years ago and was inspired by it. Well, at least I thought I wanted to be the person attended to digital garden. Or perhaps, more truthfully, it was more of a second order desire thing. I wanted to want to be that person. Nevertheless, I have toyed around and explored various tools over the years for writing, tracking, memorializing and cataloging my life. A non-exhaustive list includes:

- Notion + [Super](https://super.so/) site (current as of time of writing)
- Apple Notes
- Google Blogger
- Evernote
- Roam
- Gatsby.js personal site + blog
- Next.js personal site + blog
- ?

On some level, what I have now is fine. It works. Am I doing some personal bike shedding to avoid writing and stay in the tooling space that I am more comfortable. Perhaps. But this tweet from [Andrei Kaparthy](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1761467904737067456) and coming across a Quartz site at work finally got me to jump in.

I have migrated my workspace from Notion to Obsidian. The next tasks will be cleanup and integrating with Quartz. There is always more code to be written and things to be configured. But for at least what it is worth I have some thoughts down here.
